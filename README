This code was used for the FOSDEM2012 talk by David Chisnel on "Implementing Domain Specific Languages with LLVM"[1].

David Chisnel is the author and I do not claim ownership over his code.

I have simply taken his code [3] and modified it to work with LLVM3.3 and added a missing function implementation.
